# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch on Heart Disease Data
This repository contains code for a neural network implementation from scratch
using Python and NumPy, trained on the heart disease dataset and comapare it with tensorflow implementation.
# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
  
in this Implementation u can add whatever numbers of layers and neurons and tune the hyperparameters to achieve better results.

On the heart disease dataset, the custom neural network implementation achieved a training accuracy of 0.93 and a testing accuracy of 0.87, while the TensorFlow 
implementation achieved a training accuracy of 0.963 and a testing accuracy of 0.8519. This demonstrates the effectiveness of both implementations in accurately
classifying the presence of heart disease.
